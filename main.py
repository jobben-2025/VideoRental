#Video Rental System

#🎯 Goal
#Students will build a console-based system for renting movies, returning them, and managing members.

#🔑 Learning Focus
#Classes: Video, Customer, VideoStore
#Functions: rent, return, search, list
#Collections: use of dict and list for efficient management

#🎯 Learning Objectives
#By the end of this project, students will be able to:
#Apply Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles by creating and using classes (Video, Customer, VideoStore).
#Encapsulate functionality inside methods (e.g., rent, return, search, list).
#Use Python collections (list, dict) to store and retrieve structured data efficiently.
#Implement control flow with conditions and loops to manage system operations.
#Design modular code by splitting responsibilities across classes and functions.
#Collaborate in groups, practice version control (if used), and present solutions.

#🗓️ Weekly Breakdown

#Day 1: Define Classes
#Video: attributes → title, genre, video_id, available (bool).
#Customer: attributes → name, customer_id, rented_videos (list).
#VideoStore: manages collections of videos and customers.

#Day 1–3: Implement Core Functions
#In the VideoStore class:
#add_video(video) – add a new movie.
#add_customer(customer) – register a new customer.
#rent_video(customer_id, video_id) – customer rents if available.
#return_video(customer_id, video_id) – customer returns a video.
#list_available_videos() – show available movies.
#list_customer_videos(customer_id) – show what a customer has rented.

#Day 3–6: Extensions (Group Work)
#Encourage groups to add one or two enhancements:
#Search feature: by title or genre.
#Late fee system: calculate fee if not returned on time.
#Ratings system: customers rate videos.
#Collections: Use a dict for quick lookups (e.g. video_id -> Video).

#Day 7: Presentation & Review
#Groups demo renting/returning videos.
#Discuss use of OOP + collections.
#Compare different extensions.
